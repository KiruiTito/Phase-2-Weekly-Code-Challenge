Personal Transaction Manager

This is a basic React web application for managing personal transactions. It consists of three components: TransactionTable, Transaction, and TransactionForm.

Transaction Component
The Transaction component fetches a list of transactions from a server using the useEffect hook and displays the data in a table. It also includes a search bar and a dropdown menu for filtering the transactions based on category.

TransactionTable Component
The TransactionTable component receives the transactions as props and renders them in a table. It uses the map function to iterate through the array of transactions and create table rows for each item.

TransactionForm Component
The TransactionForm component includes a form for adding new transactions. It uses the useState hook to manage the input fields and the list of transactions. When the form is submitted, a new transaction is created and added to the list of transactions, which triggers a re-rendering of the TransactionTable component.
